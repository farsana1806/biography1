        <p>
            I am a first-year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering at the College
            of Engineering Thalassery,<br> Kerala. With a strong passion for software development 
            and web development, I am actively working towards<br> my goal of becoming a software engineer
            within the next four years. I am currently exploring both web and app<br> development,
            honing my skills through hands-on practice and continuous learning. I have a strong
            problem-solving<br> mindset that drives me to tackle challenges logically and creatively.
            My curiosity keeps me engaged with the latest<br> tech trends, coding best practices, and
            innovative approaches to product design. I am eager to grow as a developer<br> and 
            contribute meaningfully to the tech industry by building user-centric, efficient,
            and impactful digital solutions.
